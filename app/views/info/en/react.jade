                  | DevMeetings team is happy to invite you to a full-day workshop on React and Redux.
                h3 Why should you be interested in React?
                p
                  | MVC, used for many years, starts to generate problems with state of data when used in an application of larger scale. If there are many models that are connected to one another, how can we easily find out the circumstances in which the app behaves incorrectly? How to deal with updating models if they can be modified by many asynchronous events?
                h3 Flux? Redux?
                p
                  | Flux, in particular its specific implementation (Redux), seems to be the solution to this problem. To render elements we will use components of React, which is still one of the most efficient solutions for UI generating. It all provides a solid base for building scalable SPA applications.
                p
                  | On this DevMeeting you will learn about both React and Redux – and you will have a chance to practice your new skills by implementing a simple store application.

                  li

                  li
                    | React takes full advantage of the power of JavaScript; advanced algorithm for reducing operations on DOM combined with easy optimization is a great base for highly interactive interfaces

                p
                  | Redux is an application state container inspired by Flux and Elm – it is very easy to get into it, whereas benefits of using it are really great.

                    | It is devoid of defects and complexity of Flux, thanks to using a single container and the so-called reducers.
                  li
                    | It encourages using immutable data structures, which directly translates into efficiency and, above all, simplifies debugging.
                  li
                    | You can use it with any library or framework, it does not matter whether you prefer Angular, React or maybe vue.js.

                p
                  | A DevMeeting is a mix of a hackathon and a programming workshop. Throughout the day, participants implement a sample application – on their own and in teams. Experienced mentors supervise taught content and execution of a workshops and at all times offer their help, provoke discussions and share their practical knowledge.

                p
                  | A DevMeeting is not a lecture or a classic training. We focus on practical skills, coding and exchanging knowledge and experience. It is also a great opportunity to meet other developers and to make valuable contacts with developers from your city.
