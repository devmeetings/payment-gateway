              h1 Angular 2
              div
                p
                  | DevMeetings team invites you to a full-day workshop on Angular 2 with TypeScript and ES2015.
                p
                  | Although Angular 2 is still in the beta phase, its most important concepts shouldn’t change anymore. More and more development teams use this version of the framework for implementing production ready webapplications and it's the best proof that the solution is mature. If you plan to use Angular in your projects, you don't need to wait any longer. We strongly encourage to learn and master Angular 2 now - together with TypeScript, a language compiled to JavaScript.
                h3 Why Angular 2?
                p
                  | The creators of Angular 2 wanted to break with many concepts of the first version of the framework. Main objective was to introduce a solution which would perfectly cooperate with modern browsers that get support for ES2015/2016.
                
                p
                  | That is why many parts of Angular have been thoroughly analysed and created from scratch. The most important changes include:
                ul
                  li
                    | detecting changes based mainly on <b>immutable data structures</b> and <b>observable objects</b>
                  li
                    | putting stronger emphasis on writing <b>object-oriented code</b>
                  li
                    | rebuilt dependency injection container, now also allowing creating a <b>hierarchy of containers</b>
                  li
                    | major simplification of the <b>services concept</b>
                  li
                    | dynamic loading of components during the application life-cycle
                  li
                    | breaking with strict attachment to DOM, which in result enables <b>rendering on the server side</b>
                  li
                    | simplified implementation of <b>custom components<b/> and communication between them
                  li
                    | simplified <b>form management</b>
               
                p
                  | As you can see, the list of changes is quite large and some of them make a great improvement compared to the first version. Many of them are the answers to the problems and needs that have been discovered by the users working with Angular 1. Some of them also result from development of JavaScript language and improvement of browser functionalities. It means that we get a tool which is much easier to understand and use, as well as providing less of "magic" behaviour and more of the expectable ones. In a nutshell – a very good tool, tailored to meet the demands of modern front-end.

                  | During the workshop, the participants will implement a simple online shop from scratch using Angular 2, ES2015 and TypeScript and will get a chance of facing real project problems, such as:
                  ul
                    li How to use TypeScript so that it helps rather than stands in your way?
                    li How to make your application independent from the back-end for testing purposes?
                    li How to conveniently validate data in a form and send it further on?
                    li How to build components and organise communication between them so that your code does not look like spaghetti?
