                  | We create this DevMeeting thinking about developers interested in creating mobile applications using Ionic framework. If you are a web developer, you will learn how to use the web skills you already have to develop mobile applications.
                p
                  | And if you have already been creating native mobile applications will be able to learn modern web technologies and see how to apply them in mobile applications.
                p
                  | During the DevMeeting we will focus on building a hybrid mobile application for rating images downloaded from a remote website and executed by the application.
                h3 Why Ionic?
                p
                  | Ionic framework is becoming really popular all around the world. It is one of the better and most modern frameworks for building hybrid mobile applications. With Ionic SDK, we can create a mobile application for Android and iOS using the same components, as well as share business logic of the application. Ionic SDK also provides tools and services that make it much easier to create mobile applications.
                h3 For whom?
                p
                  | This DevMeeting is dedicated primarily to web developers who have experience in writing Single Page Applications. You should know JavaScript and we suggest that before DevMeeting you learn the basics of AngularJS, as Ionic is in a large extent based on this framework.
