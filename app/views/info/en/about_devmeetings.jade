              p
                | During workshops we usually implement in groups a small, but complete application. Expect substantive discussions with other developers. The workshops have a dynamic and professional, but non-formal form, focused on exchange of experience.

              p
                | DevMeetings are usually held on weekends to allow you to participate without skipping your work or studies. They last a whole day (from 8 up to even 12 hours). Due to the practical nature of the workshops (a few hours of coding), participants bring their laptops.
                | To make DevMeetings available to all interested, we decided to organise them in the Pay What You Want formula.

                | The participants of DevMeetings are both experienced developers who come to share their knowledge and discuss, and those less experienced, who still have a long way to becoming masters. There is one thing that connects us: passion. Would a person without passion spend a whole Saturday coding?

                  p
                    | For me it was especially important to listen about the things which I could discover alone only after a number of errors, attempts and a lot of wasted time (e.g. the methodology of loading responsive images and specific behaviours in different browsers). Sometimes some of these things would seem insignificant at first glance – such as BEM convention of naming classes of elements.

Also some real life use scenarios would be very welcome. Turns out Tanadu (a polish “heroes-like” browser game) was implemented 100% in plain JS. Which is quite shocking.
