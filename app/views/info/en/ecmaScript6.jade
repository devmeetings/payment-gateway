                  | ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015 is the current version of the ECMA standard, which is the base of languages such as JavaScript or ActionScript. ES6 brings significant changes compared to the previous version, which was published in 2009. Most of the browsers already offer support for some of the new features, and many more will be added soon.

                  em ECMA organization rolls out a carpet for us. The carpet on which you and I will soon walk. As of today, this carpet is not yet fully rolled out, so if you want to experience what it feels like to walk on it, you need to use linoleum, which is only a modest replacement. The linoleum of this story is transpiler, e.g. 
                  a(href='https://babeljs.io/', target='_blank') Babel.js 
                  em or
